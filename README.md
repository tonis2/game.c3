# Game

Making a 3D game with Vulkan and C3 language, 
currently very basic and only works on linux, planning to port code for Windows / MacOS soon too


### Example
For running example:

Install [C3](https://c3-lang.org/), [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

Clone repository recursively.
```sh
git clone --recursive
```
Then you can run example with `c3c run game` inside the cloned directory

Currently only tested on linux, but could potentially work on Mac too if you install MoltenVK
